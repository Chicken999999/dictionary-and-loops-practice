# print(students[3]['Email'][0])

# for student in students:

à¥‚

# for loops allow us to
#iterate through the data
#and perform some function

#we are iterating through the data
#and printing the name and email of the students
#we are also printing a line of underscores to separate the students
#we are also printing a line of underscores to separate the students
# me

#     print(student['GL'])
#     print("_"*25)

# # we are asking the user to input their name
# # then we are checking if the name is in the data
# # if the name is in the data we are printing the name and "this works"
